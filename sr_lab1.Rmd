```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(here)
# library(sf)
# library(tmap)
```

### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package.

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>%    # drops NA values from that column
  rename(tree_count = n) %>%   # renames column name
  relocate(tree_count) %>%     # makes that column the first column
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5) # keeps top 5 row values in that column
  
```
